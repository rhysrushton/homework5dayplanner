# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

# Description: 

Daily planner. 
Saves and clears entries with reference to local storage. 
Uses bootstrap, jquery, css, google fonts and moment.js. 

Still needs a bit more work:

    want to put in a random quote generator. 
    also need to fix up the clear button so that it only clears local storage specific to button.
